# Supervised-Julia

 We consider a particular kind of fractal, Julia sets, which are defined by a particular complex number known as a Julia constant. A convolutional neural network was trained using Adam stochastic gradient descent to approximate the Julia constant, given a finite resolution image of a Julia set. K-fold cross validation was used to optimize hyperparameters. The dataset was generated by us. Our results suggest that a reasonably accurate approximation of a Julia set can be computed given a finite representation of a Julia set. However, several factors such as limited resolution and image boundaries may mean that our results are not applicable in general.
